SUMMARY
At 0232 (UTC1+1) on 18 February 2015, while on passage from Belfast to Skogn, Norway the general cargo vessel Lysblink Seaways  ran aground at full speed, near  Kilchoan, Ardnamurchan peninsula, West Scotland (Figure 1) . 
The vessel remained aground for almost 2 days and, due to adverse weather  conditions, was pounded heavily onto the rocky foreshore. This caused material damage to its hull and breaching of the double bottom, including some fuel tanks, resulting in 25 tonnes of marine gas oil entering the water.
After its salvage Lysblink Seaways  was towed to dry dock where it was surveyed, declared a constructive total loss and scrapped.
The MAIB investigation found that the officer of the watch - who was the sole watchkeeper - had become inattentive at about 0200 due to the effects of alcohol consumption. 
The bridge navigational watch alarm system (BNWAS), which could have alerted the crew to the officer’s  incapacity, had not been switched on and an off-track alarm on the ECS2 had been silenced. Although a radar watch alarm had sounded every 6 minutes, the somnolent officer was able to reset the alarm without leaving his chair.
The vessel’s owner, DFDS A/S, has taken action to enhance compliance with the safety management system (SMS) on sister vessels, with particular emphasis on control of alcohol consumption and bridge resource management.
