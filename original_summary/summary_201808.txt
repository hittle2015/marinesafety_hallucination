SUMMARY
At approximately 0800 on 7 August 2018, a deckhand from the fishing vessel Fram of Shieldaig, entered the water while manoeuvring a small tender alongside the moored fishing vessel in Loch Torridon, Scotland. No-one witnessed the deckhand enter the water, but it is likely that he slipped or stumbled as he moved forwardfrom his seated helm position in preparation for passing the tender’s painter to the fishing vessel’s skipper. It is also likely that the deckhand was knocked unconscious by a bang to the head as he fell into the water.
The deckhand subsequently drowned because he was not wearing a lifejacket and the skipper was unable to recover him from the water unaided. The deckhand was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident, and this probably contributed to his fall.
This was the fifth fatal person overboard accident investigated by the MAIB since October 2015 involving fishing vessels based in remote Scottish locations. In all these cases lifejackets were not worn. Alcohol consumption was considered to be a contributing factor in 17 of 24 other fatal accidents between 1994 and 2016 involving fishermen boarding fishing vessels.
Fram of Shieldaig’s owner has reviewed the vessel’s risk assessments and introduced a policy requiring his crews to wear lifejackets at all times while working on deck and boarding and leaving the vessel. The owner has been recommended to introduce and enforce a strict alcohol and drugs policy.
