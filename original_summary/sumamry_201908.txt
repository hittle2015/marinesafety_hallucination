SUMMARY
At 0917 on 18 August 2019, the UK-registered fishing vessel Ocean Quest foundered 70 nautical miles north-east of Fraserburgh. Ocean Quest’s crew were all rescued uninjured by a coastguard helicopter; there was no pollution.
Ocean Quest was lost after flooding in the engine room. The source of the flooding has not been determined, but was almost certainly the result of a shell plating or hull weld failure beneath the main engine. Although every effort was made by the crew to bring the flood under control, the onboard pumping effort was not fully optimised as the sea water suctions had been left partly open after pumping started, which allowed the pumps to continue drawing in sea water while they were trying to drain the engine room bilge. It was also unfortunate that none of the three additional portable pumps passed across by other fishing vessels could be made to work.
Ocean Quest’s crew were well prepared for the abandonment having routinely practised for such an emergency. The alarm was raised in good time and the subsequent rescue ensured everyone was safely transferred ashore. No recommendations have been made in this report; however, this accident highlights the importance of readiness to respond to emergency situations.
