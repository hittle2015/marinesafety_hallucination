SUMMARY
At about 07361  on the morning of 28 August 2021, the skipper of the lone-operated creel2  fishing vessel Harriet J accidentally entered the water while shooting3 the fishing gear. The unmanned vessel motored away and shortly afterwards it passed close to another fishing vessel, which managed to manoeuvre alongside Harriet J so that a crewman was able to board it and take control. He confirmed that Harriet J ‘s skipper was missing. At the same time, Aberdeen Coastguard was notified and a “Mayday Relay”4  was broadcast. A search was carried out by local fishing vessels and emergency services. Just before 0900, the skipper was recovered unconscious from the water and airlifted to a hospital where, at 0955, he was declared deceased.
The MAIB investigation found that the skipper of Harriet J, who was working alone although operating the vessel in the same area as other family-owned vessels, probably became entangled while the fishing gear was being deployed. He was neither wearing a personal flotation device (PFD) nor a personal locator beacon (PLB)5  and there were no effective barriers to separate him from the fishing gear on the vessel’s and not in a misleading context. The material must working deck.
A recommendation has been made to the Fishing Industry Safety Group (FISG) to expedite the delivery of the outcomes of its working group focusing on the safety of lone-operated fishing vessels.
