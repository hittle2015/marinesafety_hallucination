SUMMARY
At approximately 1142 (UTC1+1) on Saturday 2 May 2015, an unnamed Fletcher
speedboat with one adult and three teenage children on board capsized after encountering a large wave. Three of the occupants managed to swim clear of the upturned hull but one of the children became trapped.  Despite valiant attempts to free her, she was only recovered following attendance of the RNLI lifeboat 25 minutes later. Although medical treatment then started immediately, she never ecovered consciousness.
The investigation found that a strap on the back of the girl's buoyancy aid had become snagged on the speedboat's starboard aft mooring cleat. The buoyancy aid she wore was not a close fit, increasing the opportunity for it to become snagged.
In addition to the speedboat's course and speed in the prevailing sea conditions, potential contributing factors that led to the boat's capsize were the fitting of a new propeller to the outboard engine, the small quantity of fuel in the bow tank and the manner in which the engine speed was increased prior to the accident.
The Royal Yachting Association and British Water Ski and Wakeboard intend to publicise the safety issues from this accident which include: the need to consult weather forecasts before taking craft to sea; potential shortcomings of boats constructed prior to 1996; the need for buoyancy aids and lifejackets to be a close fit and; the importance of wearing a kill cord when operating a speedboat. As a consequence, no recommendations have been issued with this report.
