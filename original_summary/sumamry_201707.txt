SUMMARY
At 0304:401  on 1 July 2017, two Hong Kong registered vessels, the bulk carrier Huayang Endeavour and the oil tanker Seafrontier, collided in the Dover Strait approximately 5 nautical miles (nm) to the west of Sandettie Bank. Both vessels were damaged in the collision but were able to proceed to nearby ports for damage assessment. The accident did not result in any injuries or pollution.
The MAIB investigation identified that a VHF2  radio conversation between Huayang Endeavour and Seafrontier had resulted in the two bridge teams holding conflicting views as to what had been agreed regarding Huayang Endeavour overtaking Seafrontier. Subsequently, Seafrontier＊s bridge team did not check for sea room astern before altering course, leading to a close quarter situation between the two vessels. Seafrontier＊s master had been present on the bridge for over 14 hours and was probably suffering from fatigue, which was likely to have had an adverse effect on his decision making.
Following its internal investigation, Huayang Maritime Centre, the manager of Huayang Endeavour, has amended its procedures for the use of VHF for collision avoidance, and promulgated the lessons learned from this accident to its fleet. Valles Steamship Company Ltd, the manager of Sea Frontier, has also completed an internal investigation, and has taken a number of steps to train its personnel in bridge and crew resource management, review its procedures, and promulgated the lessons from this accident to its fleet. In light of the actions already taken, no recommendations have been made.
