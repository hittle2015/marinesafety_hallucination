SUMMARY
At 02461 on 1 March 2018, the UK registered general cargo vessel Celtic Spirit  dragged its anchor in heavy weather on the River Humber, England. The vessel subsequently collided with the research and survey vessel Atlantic Explorer  and the general cargo vessel Celtic Warrior , which were also at anchor. All three vessels sustained shell plate damage, but there were no injuries and no pollution.
The MAIB investigation identified that:
Celtic Spirit  dragged its anchor because insufficient anchor cable had been deployed for the tidal range and environmental conditions experienced
It was not immediately identified that Celtic Spirit  was dragging its anchor because the anchor position monitoring was inadequate.
Celtic Spirit ’s bridge watchkeeper did not alert Vessel Traffic Services or nearby vessels that his own ship was dragging anchor.
Celtic Spirit  was unable to manoeuvre in sufficient time to remedy the situation because its engine was not on immediate readiness, and class conditions relating to engine readiness while operating with only one anchor were not followed or understood.
Lack of company guidance meant that there was an inconsistent approach to engine readiness on board sister vessels in the same fleet.
Atlantic Explorer  and Ce ltic Warrior  were unable to weigh their anchors in the time available.
Celtic Spirit ’s owner, Charles M. Willie & Co (Shipping) Ltd, has taken action, with its fleet, to raise the standards of anchor watchkeeping and to clarify the term ‘main engine stand-by’. ABP Humber has completed an anchorage review and has implemented measures designed to mitigate the risk factors identified during the investigation. No recommendations have been made in this report.
