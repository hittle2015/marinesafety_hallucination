SUMMARY
On 18 February 2020, the Ardintoul fish farm assistant manager, Clive Hendry, drowned after falling into the water from a feed barge access ladder during a boat transfer. He was attempting to climb on to the barge from the workboat Beinn Na Caillich and fell into the water after being crushed between the boat and the barge. A fish farm technician attempted to stop the assistant manager from entering the water by holding onto the back of his personal flotation device and oilskin jacket, but the severely injured casualty slipped out of them.
The investigation concluded that the conduct of the boat transfer had not been properly planned or briefed and was not adequately controlled. A risk assessment for the transfer of personnel to and from the fish farm installations had not been carried out and a documented safe system of work had not been produced. Recommendations have been made to the vessel and fish farm owner, Mowi (Scotland) Ltd, to apply The Workboat Code Edition 2 to its fleet and implement a safety management system that complies with the principles of the International Safety Management Code.
A recommendation to ensure that appropriate marine expertise is present or provided to the senior management team to oversee the safety of its vessels and marine operations has also been made to the owner.
