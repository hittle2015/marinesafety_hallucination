SUMMARY
On 28 January 2013, the 6.45m single handed fishing boat JCK (Figure 1) failed to return to port, prompting a major search to be mounted by the coastguard.  The RNLI recovered the skipper’s body from the sea several hours later.  Although some flotsam from JCK was found, the boat was not located and is believed to have foundered in rough seas and winds gusting in excess of 50 knots at around 1750 UTC.
The MAIB investigation identified that JCK was heavily laden following a successful day’s fishing in Babbacombe Bay, Devon. The skipper’s decision to leave the shelter of that bay and return to port through forecast strong winds and seas was an error of judgment that cost him his life. 
No recommendations have been issued as a consequence of this investigation.
