SUMMARY
At 0556 UTC  on 16 February 2013, the port fin stabiliser of the passenger / ro-ro cargo ferry Finnarrow made contact with the berth as she arrived at Holyhead, UK. The fin stabiliser subsequently punctured the hull, which led to the pump room flooding. All passengers were disembarked, cargo was unloaded and the vessel’s onboard services crew were sent ashore. Once divers had plugged the hole in the hull and the shore fire service had employed a high-volume pump, the water level in the pump room was reduced to below the floor plates and a cement box was constructed to seal the leak.

The investigation found that the procedures for pre-arrival checks were inadequate. It also concluded that the crew lacked sufficient familiarity with the vessel’s equipment and emergency procedures; issues that had been raised during a recent port state control inspection. Finnlines Ship Management reported it has implemented several improvements to its safety management system. However, the MAIB has made recommendations to the company aimed at improving awareness of the status of the vessel’s fin stabilisers and ensuring its crews are properly prepared to deal effectively with emergencies.
