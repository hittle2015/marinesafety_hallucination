SUMMARY
On the morning of 12 January 2022, two men were found unconscious on board the sports cruiser, Emma Louise, which was berthed in Port Hamble Marina, on the River Hamble, England. It was later established that both men had died because of carbon monoxide poisoning.
The two men had boarded the boat the previous evening and had left the engine running while they remained in the boat’s covered cockpit area. The MAIB investigation concluded that the boat’s exhaust gas, which contained carbon monoxide, had likely been funnelled into the cockpit by an inflatable towable ski ring that was suspended from the transom of Emma Louise. The levels of carbon monoxide would have increased in the cockpit, rendering both men unconscious and causing their deaths. There was no means of alerting the men to the danger because a carbon monoxide alarm had not been fitted to the boat.
In November 2022, the MAIB participated in raising awareness of hazards to boat users during Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week and, in conjunction with the publication of this report, has issued a flyer to summarise this accident and highlight the key safety lessons to the boating community.
