SUMMARY
At 1424 (BST1) on 28 April 2016, the 11.6 metre potter Harvester (Figure 1) grounded on rocks in Abereiddy Bay, North Pembrokeshire, and foundered a short time later. There was no indication of any crew on board at the time of the grounding. A large-scale search and rescue operation commenced and the body of Gareth Willington was recovered from the water 3 miles from where Harvester had foundered. He was not wearing a lifejacket or other buoyancy aid. The second crew member, Daniel Willington, has not been found despite an extensive search.
The MAIB investigation concluded that both crew members probably went overboard while shooting gear in the vicinity of Ramsey Island during the morning of 28 April.
A recommendation has previously been made to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to make arrangements to rapidly introduce the compulsory wearing of personal flotation devices on the upper decks of all fishing vessels while at sea. No additional recommendations have been made in this report.
